# Scratch Block Selector Clone
(Not finished)

### Things I am thinking about adding
  1. Dropdowns
  2. Display Responsiveness
  3. Dragging the blocks onto the right side. (Without the blocks doing anything)

> [!WARNING]
> Known issues that I don't know how to fix:
> 1. When typing a large amount of text in the input boxes, the blocks scroll off to the left.
> ~~2. When typing a large enough amount of letters (not numbers) in an input box, it leaves a lot of space on the left and right.~~ (the ch unit in css is based on the width of the number 0; the letter widths are different so it made it inconsistent. Font is now monospaced.)
> 2. Focusing and bluring input boxes too quickly causes the text inside to appear selected for a moment and then for it to all deselect.

I made this for no reason.
